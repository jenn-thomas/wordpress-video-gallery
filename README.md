# Wordpress Video Gallery

A wordpress plugin that creates a video gallery by using a shortcode. This was originally written for the [Novel Engineering Project](http://www.novelengineering.org/) when it was a wordpress website. 

## Settings
The plugin converts videos using ffmpeg and code from the video component portion of the [SmartPost wordpress plugin](https://github.com/tuftsceeo/smartpost). The user can also add and delete tags for their videos.

## Adding a Video

A user can drag and drop a video file, which will be automatically converted if the user has selected that option. The user can then add a title, description, and tag the video.
